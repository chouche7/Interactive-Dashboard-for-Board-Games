# interactive_dashboard_boardgames

If you would like to run the interactive line chart or choropleth map, I suggest using Visual Code Studio and installing Live Server by Ritwick Dey

One you have the D3 libraries and data downloaded, simply run the necessary code file to have the dashboards showup.
